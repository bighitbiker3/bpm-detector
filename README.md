# bpm-detector

Based highly off of Joe Sullivan's solution here: http://joesul.li/van/beat-detection-using-web-audio/

This is currently working well for 4/4 beats and things with harder kick drums.  Needs to be tweaked to handle break-beat things and hopefully rely less on the kick drum and low-end.
